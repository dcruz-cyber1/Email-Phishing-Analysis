# Email-Phishing-Analysis

Read me 

This project is a phishing email trying to impersonating Microsoft Outlook Support. The sample, sourced from a public .eml repository, was examined using forensic tools to assess its metadata, delivery path, social engineering tactics, and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

The goal was to see how the email showed up on authentication controls and identify threat indicators a Tier 1 SOC analyst could use.

Tools Used
GitHub – For sourcing .eml phishing samples
Mozilla Thunderbird – Safely opening and inspecting raw email headers and metadata
VirusTotal – Detecting potential malicious payloads in attachments
MXToolbox – Analyzing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results from headers
Google Header Analyzer – Tracing routing, delivery path, and delays



Skills Demonstrated
Email threat triage
IOC extraction
Header and authentication analysis
Social engineering assessment
Communicating threat intelligence clearly



Final Notes
This project showcases skills expected of a Tier 1 SOC analyst, identifying and documenting phishing threats, authentication results, and recognizing social engineering techniques in real email attacks.
